ets-url-shortener is a web application that was co-developed with [Vincent Chan](https://eve-liya.github.io/) for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge in 2022. This proof-of-concept website was developed for Hawaii's Office of Enterprise Technology Services to create a secure way for state workers to share and distribute short URLs.

Out of the fourty-four teams that participated in the challenge, **our team brought first place for the "Coded Solutions" category.**
