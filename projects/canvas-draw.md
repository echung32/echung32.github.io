This is a basic web application developed in Niu Valley Middle School's Computer Science Club. This club introduced me to basic website development, including the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. I learned how to interact with the DOM through JavaScript in order to modify the content on the page, and how to add basic styles to the HTML code by attaching class names and IDs to the objects. This project was done individually, under the guidance of the club's teacher.

## Future Improvements
The current version of this program is quite inflexible, as it requires the user to type in the coordinates to draw on the canvas with a very limited set of shapes. If I were to do this project again today, this is what I would change:

- Use a web framework like React.
- Add gridlines, coordinate positions, onto the canvas.
- Allow shape previews, to see what the shape would look like after the data has been entered.
- Allow drag-and-dropping the shapes instead of manually typing in the coordinates.
