<h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of various fields, including education, where its applications range from automated grading systems to personalized learning tools. In the realm of Software Engineering, AI tools and methodologies have been increasingly employed to enhance the learning experience. In the context of ICS 314, and even in other classes, the integration of AI, including tools like ChatGPT, Bard (by Google), and GitHub Copilot, has presented unique opportunities and challenges. It has brought forth a simple way to receive instant feedback on what you’re doing, but at the same time, I don’t want to rely too much on AI to do everything for me. This essay goes into my personal experiences with artificial intelligence in primarily ICS 314, but also in other courses.</p>

<h2 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II. Personal Experience with AI</h2>

<p>Experience WODs e.g. E18
I did not use AI to experience WODs. Although I was unfamiliar with the Underscore library, the documentation was simple and enough to understand how to accomplish the task. It would have been a little faster to use ChatGPT, but I felt like the time is negligible and I would likely remember better since I put in that little extra effort to search for the function that I needed.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-practice-wods">In-class Practice WODs</h3>
<p>I did not use AI for the practice of WODs, as most of the difficulty lies in understanding Bootstrap and the frameworks like React or Meteor. Although I am not particularly experienced in these, I was able to wrap my head around the content and I never felt pressured in any of the WODs to use AI.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-wods">In-class WODs</h3>
<p>I did not use AI for the in-class WODs since I felt like the content was not particularly difficult. The in-class WODs had straightforward instructions that you could follow to get to the final result needed. I felt like it would have been more of a necessity to use AI for the practice WODs since they gave less information than the in-class ones.</p>

<h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>
<p>I only use ChatGPT to help me revise my essay <em>after</em> I’ve already written most of the content. This makes it so it would mostly be my own content, with a couple revisions and suggestions to how I could improve the essay or make some things more clear. I write a prompt that is something like “This essay is about [some general background on the essay]. Please help provide suggestions on how I could improve the essays, like improving clarity.” Then, I’ll read through the essay and manually correct the things that the AI outputs.</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final project</h3>
<p>For the final project, I relied primarily on reading online documentation rather than ChatGPT, since the information that I actually required had to be in 2023, but these models were trained from data in 2022. It would not be useful to use it since it wouldn’t know about how these libraries that I was using worked.</p>

<h3 id="learning-a-concept--tutorial">Learning a concept / tutorial</h3>
<p>For learning a new concept, or for a tutorial, I sometimes rely on ChatGPT, but most of the time I’d prefer to use structured tutorials that have been written by humans. These tutorials could be from freecodecamp or similar websites. I think that they tend to be more reliable as the person who wrote that tutorial would have tested everything and confirmed that the tutorial is working. Of course, there is a possibility that something in the library changed and the tutorial is outdated – but in that case, I can search up the issue or rely on ChatGPT to help me debug that. This basically involved just copying and pasting the error into ChatGPT, as I would do when I google, and trying out what it suggests.</p>

<h3 id="answering-a-question-in-class-or-in-discord">Answering a question in class or in Discord</h3>
<p>I have not used AI in answering questions in class or in Discord since I think that, if the AI could answer it, then they might as well have asked AI before asking in the server. Of course, when I do experience something like the instructions being incorrect, I would share that knowledge with others.</p>

<h3 id="asking-or-answering-a-smart-question">Asking or answering a smart-question</h3>
<p>I have not asked or answered a smart-question on the server because I feel that, most of the time, someone has already asked and answered the issue that I had already. This is partially the advantage of doing the homework a little later, since there are people to vet out the problems before I have to do it myself. If I did run into a problem though, then I’d rely on Google or ask ChatGPT (copy and pasting the error) instead of asking a smart-question.</p>

<h3 id="coding-example-eg-give-an-example-of-using-underscore-pluck">Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”</h3>
<p>I have not used AI for coding examples, but I think that it would be a powerful tool to help quickly learn the syntax of various libraries. It does fall under the same problem, however, of the dataset that ChatGPT has on older data and it sometimes may not match the library exactly.</p>

<h3 id="explaining-code">Explaining code</h3>
<p>I have not used AI to explain my code for me since, if it was me who wrote the code, then I would know what it did. Even if I hadn’t touched it for a while, I will be able to dig around in the code and figure it out in a reasonable amount of time. This is an essential skill to learn, I think, since if you are able to explain the code, it means that you understand the content well.</p>

<h3 id="writing-code">Writing code</h3>
<p>I haven’t used AI to write code since I think that using AI for writing code is not helpful in understanding the concepts behind it. I would, however, understand using it to quickly create utility functions that you have already created or copy and pasted hundreds of times before.</p>

<h3 id="documenting-code">Documenting code</h3>
<p>I haven’t used AI to document my code since I typically document as I go for things that I know are likely to be confusing in the future, i.e. any algorithms that I’m using.</p>

<h3 id="quality-assurance-eg-whats-wrong-with-this-code--or-fix-the-eslint-errors-in-">Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here="">” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here="">”</code></code></h3>
<p>I have sometimes used ChatGPT to help me figure out what was wrong with a piece of code, which involved pasting the code in, pasting in an error (or my expected output), and asking what is wrong with it. However, I have never used it to help fix ESLint errors. This is because your IDE already does that for you.</p>

<h3 id="other-uses-in-ics-314-not-listed">Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h3>
<p>I think that the list provided above is comprehensive and I don’t recall using AI for anything else.</p>

<h2 id="iii-impact-on-learning-and-understanding">III. Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
<p>I think that, for me, my selective use of AI in ICS 314 has a somewhat positive impact on my learning experience. In tasks like the experience and in-class wods, I deliberately emphasize manual exploration and problem solving to be more engaged with the material. This, I believe, helps me remember the content better since I wasn’t given the answer instantly via ChatGPT. For essays, while it served as a valuable tool for revisions, I purposefully limited myself on using it only for revisions and not for it to write the entire essay by itself. And when trying to learn a new skill, I prefer using human-curated tutorials as I felt that they would be better vetted to work if I followed them to a T. The impact of AI on learning was more pronounced when used as a supplementary tool rather than a primary resource, promoting a balanced and enriched educational experience.</p>

<h2 id="iv-practical-applications">IV. Practical Applications</h2>
<p>In practical applications, I felt like there are limitations on AI, particularly in the fact that ChatGPT can’t access real-time information. In the final project, our group wanted to use new technologies, which ChatGPT would know little to nothing about during the time that it was trained. This made it more important to learn how to source information from the documentation itself. This reflects a recognition of the specific contexts where AI tools may not be the most effective, emphasizing the importance of discernment in integrating AI into real-world software engineering projects.</p>

<h2 id="v-challenges-and-opportunities">V. Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<p>The challenges and opportunities arising from the use of AI in ICS 314 are nuanced. Challenges include the potential reliance on outdated data within AI models and the risk of hindering critical thinking if overused. Opportunities lie in the power of AI to expedite certain tasks, such as providing code snippets or aiding in debugging. Striking a balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and preserving the necessity for independent problem-solving emerges as a key consideration for optimizing its role in software engineering education.</p>

<h2 id="vi-comparative-analysis">VI. Comparative Analysis</h2>
<p>I think that there are nuances to AI-enhanced approaches in software engineering. It is a crucial skill to learn how to effectively use AI to your advantage, but I feel that it is too easy to use AI as a way to skimp out on one’s learning. It also doesn’t particularly help if the students who are using AI don’t understand, for example, the code that is being written for them. AI excels in rapid information retrieval, but traditional methods help foster critical thinking and creativity since you don’t necessarily have access to getting your problems solved in a snap. Combining both of these requires a perfect balance. Structured tutorials are crucial and must be retained as a traditional teaching method. The effective integration of AI depends on recognizing its strengths in tandem with the intrinsic value of traditional teaching methods.</p>

<h2 id="vii-future-considerations">VII. Future Considerations</h2>
<p>There are many things to take into consideration for the future of AI in software engineering education. The advantages are many, such as the fact that it can provide context-aware personalized learning experiences and provide instant feedback, but people should be cautious of not relying too heavily on AI to maintain our own creativity and ethical decision-making. I think that future considerations would be to refine the use of AI with evolving software practices and ensure that we’re getting the best of both worlds. It would undoubtedly be a major mistake to replace traditional teaching methods outright.</p>

<h2 id="viii-conclusion">VIII. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I think that the integration of AI in software engineering presents a nuanced impact. AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, or Copilot should be used as supplementary resources. This, I believe, is the right choice to positively influence learning engagement and retention. It’s also (not yet) a direct replacement for manually reading documentation. Although AI is extremely useful in helping with tasks like essay revisions, technology is constantly evolving and ChatGPT only knows what it is able to know from their own datasets.</p>

<p>In projects that use bleeding-edge technology, we aren’t able to rely on ChatGPT to help understand the library and how to use it. That is a careful consideration that must be made when suggesting the use of AI for some classes. Fortunately, the technologies used in this class are ancient, so that is not a problem.</p>

<p>Striking a balance between AI efficiency and the preservation of independent problem-solving skills emerges as crucial. Looking ahead, the future role of AI in software engineering education should focus on refining its use in tandem with evolving software practices, ensuring a harmonious integration that capitalizes on AI’s strengths without compromising the essential aspects of traditional teaching methods.</p>
